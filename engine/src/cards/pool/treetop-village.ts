// EDHREC rank 5824.
//
// Rulings:
//   [2008-08-01] A noncreature permanent that turns into a creature can attack, and its {T}
//     abilities can be activated, only if its controller has continuously controlled that
//     permanent since the beginning of their most recent turn. It doesn't matter how long the
//     permanent has been a creature.
//   [2009-10-01] Activating the ability that turns it into a creature while it's already a
//     creature will override any effects that set its power and/or toughness to a specific number.
//     However, any effect that raises or lowers power and/or toughness (such as the effect created
//     by Giant Growth, Glorious Anthem, or a +1/+1 counter) will continue to apply.

// Faerie Conclave's shape.
