/**
 * The `CardDefinition` shape and the `defineCard` builder.
 *
 * This is the *framework* for authoring cards — the vocabulary, not the pool.
 * The pool lives in `pool/` and `tokens/` (one file per card) and is stitched
 * together into `BUILTIN_CARDS` by the generated `generated.ts` (see
 * `scripts/gen-cards.mjs`). `cards.ts` re-exports everything here so existing
 * `import … from "./cards.js"` sites are unaffected.
 *
 * Behavior is authored declaratively (`effect`). Cards whose rules text the
 * declarative vocab can't express carry an imperative `resolve` script (the
 * escape hatch). Vanilla permanents need neither.
